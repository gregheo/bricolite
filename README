Bricolite - A SOAP-powered minimal interface to Bricolage
=========================================================

Bricolite presents a simplified user interface to Bricolage. Users can create,
view, update recent stories, and nothing more.

This code is meant as a starting point rather than an out-of-the-box solution,
as Bricolage installations are by nature very different from each other
(story types and elements, output channels, use of keywords, contributors,
permissions, etc.) This code as-distributed should work on a stock Bricolage
install as it only references the root category and the "story" element type.
